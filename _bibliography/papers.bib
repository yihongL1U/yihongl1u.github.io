    abstract={Transliterating related languages that use different scripts into a common script shows effectiveness in improving crosslingual transfer in downstream tasks. However, this methodology often makes pretraining a model from scratch unavoidable, as transliteration brings about new subwords not covered in existing multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs). This is not desired because it takes a lot of computation budget for pretraining. A more promising way is to make full use of available mPLMs. To this end, this paper proposes a simple but effective framework: Transliterate-Merge-Initialize (TransMI), which can create a strong baseline well-suited for data that is transliterated into a common script by exploiting an mPLM and its accompanied tokenizer. TransMI has three stages: (a) transliterate the vocabulary of an mPLM into a common script; (b) merge the new vocabulary with the original vocabulary; and (c) initialize the embeddings of the new subwords. We applied TransMI to three recent strong mPLMs, and our experiments demonstrate that TransMI not only preserves their ability to handle non-transliterated data, but also enables the models to effectively process transliterated data: the results show a consistent improvement of 3% to 34%, varying across different models and tasks. We make our code and models publicly available.},

    arxiv={2401.06620},
    abstract={There are 293 scripts representing over 7,000 languages in the written form. Due to various reasons, many closely related languages use different scripts, which poses difficulty for multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) in learning crosslingual knowledge through lexical overlap. As a result, mPLMs present a script barrier: representations from different scripts are located in different subspaces, which is a strong indicator of why crosslingual transfer involving languages of different scripts shows sub-optimal performance. To address this problem, we propose a simple framework TransliCo that contains Transliteration Contrastive Modeling (TCM) to fine-tune an mPLM by contrasting sentences in its training data and their transliterations in a unified script (Latn, in our case), which ensures uniformity in the representation space for different scripts. Using Glot500-m, an mPLM pretrained on over 500 languages, as our source model, we find-tune it on a small portion (5\%) of its training data, and refer to the resulting model as Furina. We show that Furina not only better aligns representations from distinct scripts but also outperforms the original Glot500-m on various crosslingual transfer tasks. Additionally, we achieve consistent improvement in a case study on the Indic group where the languages are highly related but use different scripts. We make our code and models publicly available.},

  abstract={Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, pre-training such models can take considerable resources that are almost only available to high-resource languages. On the contrary, static word embeddings are easier to train in terms of computing resources and the amount of data required. In this paper, we introduce MoSECroT Model Stitching with Static Word Embeddings for Crosslingual Zero-shot Transfer), a novel and challenging task that is especially relevant to low-resource languages for which static word embeddings are available. To tackle the task, we present the first framework that leverages relative representations to construct a common space for the embeddings of a source language PLM and the static word embeddings of a target language. In this way, we can train the PLM on source-language training data and perform zero-shot transfer to the target language by simply swapping the embedding layer. However, through extensive experiments on two classification datasets, we show that although our proposed framework is competitive with weak baselines when addressing MoSECroT, it fails to achieve competitive results compared with some strong baselines. In this paper, we attempt to explain this negative result and provide several thoughts on possible improvement.},

   abstract={Pretraining multilingual language models from scratch requires considerable computational resources and substantial training data. Therefore, a more efficient method is to adapt existing pretrained language models (PLMs) to new languages via vocabulary extension and continued pretraining. However, this method usually randomly initializes the embeddings of new subwords and introduces substantially more embedding parameters to the language model, thus weakening the efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{O}ne \textbf{F}or \textbf{A}ll (\textbf{\textsc{Ofa}}), which wisely initializes the embeddings of unseen subwords from target languages and thus can adapt a PLM to multiple languages efficiently and effectively. \textsc{Ofa} takes advantage of external well-aligned multilingual word embeddings and injects the alignment knowledge into the new embeddings. In addition, \textsc{Ofa} applies matrix factorization and replaces the cumbersome embeddings with two lower-dimensional matrices, which significantly reduces the number of parameters while not sacrificing the performance. Through extensive experiments, we show models initialized by \textsc{Ofa} are efficient and outperform several baselines. \textsc{Ofa} not only accelerates the convergence of continued pretraining, which is friendly to a limited computation budget, but also improves the zero-shot crosslingual transfer on a wide range of downstream tasks. We make our code and models publicly available.},

    abstract={Colexification in comparative linguistics refers to the phenomenon of a lexical form conveying two or more distinct meanings. In this paper, we propose simple and effective methods to build multilingual graphs from colexification patterns: ColexNet and ColexNet+. ColexNet's nodes are concepts and its edges are colexifications. In ColexNet+, concept nodes are in addition linked through intermediate nodes, each representing an ngram in one of 1,334 languages. We use ColexNet+ to train high-quality multilingual embeddings $\overrightarrow{\mbox{ColexNet+}}$ that are well-suited for transfer learning scenarios. Existing work on colexification patterns relies on annotated word lists. This limits scalability and usefulness in NLP. In contrast, we identify colexification patterns of more than 2,000 concepts across 1,335 languages directly from an unannotated parallel corpus. In our experiments, we first show that ColexNet has a high recall on CLICS, a dataset of crosslingual colexifications. We then evaluate $\overrightarrow{\mbox{ColexNet+}}$ on roundtrip translation, verse retrieval and verse classification and show that our embeddings surpass several baselines in a transfer learning setting. This demonstrates the benefits of colexification for multilingual NLP.},

We investigate these differences in conceptualization across 1,335 languages by aligning concepts in a parallel corpus. To this end, we propose Conceptualizer, a method that creates a bipartite directed alignment graph between source language concepts and sets of target language strings. In a detailed linguistic analysis across all languages for one concept ({`}bird{'}) and an evaluation on gold standard data for 32 Swadesh concepts, we show that Conceptualizer has good alignment accuracy. We demonstrate the potential of research on conceptualization in NLP with two experiments. (1) We define crosslingual stability of a concept as the degree to which it has 1-1 correspondences across languages, and show that concreteness predicts stability. (2) We represent each language by its conceptualization pattern for 83 concepts, and define a similarity measure on these representations. The resulting measure for the conceptual similarity between two languages is complementary to standard genealogical, typological, and surface similarity measures. For four out of six language families, we can assign languages to their correct family based on conceptual similarity with accuracies between 54{\%} and 87{\%}",

We find this issue is closely related to an unexpected copying behavior during online back-translation (BT). In this work, we propose a simple but effective training schedule that incorporates a language discriminator loss. The loss imposes constraints on the intermediate translation so that the translation is in the desired language. By conducting extensive experiments on different language pairs, including similar and distant, high and low-resource languages, we find that our method alleviates the copying problem, thus improving the translation performance on low-resource languages.",

This architecture allows for unsupervised training of each language independently. While there is prior work on latent variables for supervised MT, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses latent variables and normalizing flows for unsupervised MT. We obtain competitive results on several unsupervised MT benchmarks.",

Existing sentence representation generation approaches which serve for classification tasks generally rely on complex deep neural networks but relatively simple loss functions, such as cross entropy loss function. These approaches cannot produce satisfactory separable sentence representations because the usage of cross entropy may ignore the sentiment and semantic information of the labels. To extract useful information from labels for improving the distinguishability of the obtained sentence representations, this paper proposes a label-oriented loss function. The proposed loss function takes advantage of the word-embeddings of labels to guide the production of meaningful sentence representations which serve for downstream classification tasks. Compared with existing end-to-end approaches, the evaluation experiments on several datasets illustrate that using the proposed loss function can achieve competitive and even better classification results.},
