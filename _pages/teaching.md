## Colloquium und Repetitorium zu Computerlinguistisches Arbeiten (Colloquium and Repetitorium on Computational Linguistics)

SS 2023, 2024, Bachelor class  
  
  
In this class we will talk about useful topics for the preparation of a Bachelor thesis. Some companies will briefly present the work of a computer linguists in a their company and students will have to chance to get an overview of the tasks and projects they will be working on as computational linguists.


## Einf√ºhrung in die Computerlinguistik (Introduction to Computational Linguistics)

WS 2023/2024, WS 2024/2025, Bachelor class  
  
  
This class will be divided into two parts: the linguistics part and the statistics part. In the linguistic part, we will talk about topics such as Phonetics, Morphology, and Syntax. In the statistics part, we will talk about topics such as Naive Bayes, Machine Translation, and Parsing. The class aims to provide a foundational understanding of computational linguistics.

## Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

WS 2024/2025, Master class  


In this class, we will talk about the fundamental knowledge of deep learning and how this knowledge is applied in natural language processing. This class offers a theoretical part and a practical part. In the practical part, students will be given 5 projects from which the students can obtain some hands-on experience in how to use a deep learning framework (PyTorch) to define, train, finetune, and evaluate language models on different tasks.
